  "body": "# CK2-Music-Script-Generator\r\nAutomatically generate a basic script for all the music in your CK2 music mod.\r\n\r\n##Instructions\r\n\r\n* You need Python 3. This script was written and tested on Python 3.5.1 but slightly older versions should work as well.\r\n\r\n* DO NOT try to run this script on Python 2. Python 3 and Python 2 are not compatible with each other.\r\n\r\n* You can download the appropriate verison of Python 3 from https://www.python.org/downloads/\r\n  * If you use an OS with a package manager (most mainstream *nixes) you can download python3 from there if you do not already have it.\r\n\r\n* This program is invoked from a command line interface. I have only tested it on a linux terminal, but you should be able\r\nto run it on a Windows Powershell (preferred) or Command Prompt without problems, especially with the default.\r\n\r\n* Depending on what your default python executable is, on most machines you will either execute the program as \r\n  * `python3 msg.py [options]` OR\r\n  * `python msg.py [options]`\r\n  * Default options are supplied. Use `python msg.py -h` to learn what they are and how to customize their values.\r\n\r\nI hope you find this program useful!\r\n\r\nThis program is licensed under the GPLv2 only.\r\n",
