# CK2-Music-Script-Generator
Automatically generate a basic script for all the music in your CK2 music mod.

##Instructions

* You need Python 3. This script was written and tested on Python 3.5.1 but slightly older versions should work as well.

* DO NOT try to run this script on Python 2. Python 3 and Python 2 are not compatible with each other.

* You can download the appropriate verison of Python 3 from https://www.python.org/downloads/
  * If you use an OS with a package manager (most mainstream *nixes) you can download python3 from there if you do not already have it.

* This program is invoked from a command line interface. I have only tested it on a linux terminal, but you should be able
to run it on a Windows Powershell (preferred) or Command Prompt without problems, especially with the default.

* Depending on what your default python executable is, on most machines you will either execute the program as 
  * `python3 msg.py [options]` OR
  * `python msg.py [options]`
  * Default options are supplied. Use `python msg.py -h` to learn what they are and how to customize their values.

I hope you find this program useful!
